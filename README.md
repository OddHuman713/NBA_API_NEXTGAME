# NBA_API_NEXTGAME
These versions of code are made to take the ESPN ID of any NBA team (TEAM_ID), and access an ESPN API to harvest data on the time and date of said team's next game.
It also identifies both team's records and logos and prints them into the HTML or GUI. 
The HTML version is intended for MacOS and is a single file.
